[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} able to bear you myself alone:}\\

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{The LORD your \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God} hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye \emph{are} this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{(The LORD \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God} of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye \emph{are}, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Take you wise men, and \fcolorbox{bone}{MYGOLD}{understanding}, and known among your tribes, and I will make them \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{rulers} over you.}

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} come.}
[23] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:}
[24] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.}
[25] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought \emph{it} down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, \emph{It} \emph{is} a good land which the LORD our \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God} doth give us.}
[26] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Notwithstanding ye would \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God}:}
[27] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.}
[28] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Whither \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people \emph{is} greater and taller than we; the cities \emph{are} great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{sons of the Anakims} there.}
[29] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then I said unto you, Dread \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not}, neither be afraid of them.}

[31] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God} bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.}
[32] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Yet in this thing ye did \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} believe the LORD your \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God},}
[33] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents \emph{in}, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.}
[34] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,}
[35] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Surely there \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} one of these men of this \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{evil generation} see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,}
[36] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.}
[37] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} go in thither.}
[38] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{\emph{But} Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} go in thither: encourage him: for he \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} cause Israel to inherit it.}
[39] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{shall} possess it.}
[40] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But \emph{as} \emph{for} you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.}
[41] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{God} commanded us.

[42] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} up, neither fight; for I \emph{am} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.}
[43] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So I spake unto you; and ye would \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.}
[44] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, \emph{even} unto Hormah.}
[45] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{not} hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.}
[46] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode \emph{there}.}
