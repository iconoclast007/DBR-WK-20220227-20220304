[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD spake unto me, saying,}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Ye have compassed this mountain \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{long enough}: turn you northward.}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And command thou the people, saying, Ye \emph{are} to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{I have given} mount Seir unto Esau \emph{for} a possession.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{walking} through this great \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{wilderness}: these forty years the LORD thy God \emph{hath} \emph{been} with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.}
[8] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{wilderness} of Moab.}
[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{I will not} give thee of their land \emph{for} a possession; because \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{I have given} Ar unto the children of Lot \emph{for} a possession.}
[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.}
