The one who would “swallow” David up would do it literally if he could (see all the references that Larkin, Kirban, Lindsay, Webber, Rockwood, Bob Jones III, Pentecost, Church, et al., missed: Isa. 6:13; Rev. 6:9–11; Jer. 51:34; and Ps. 27:2). A Christian is saved by mercy and truth (see Isa. 61:5). The order is reversed before the sinner is saved, for he must hear the truth first and believe it before God can have mercy on him. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }

The traditional way to get rid of these prophecies is to pretend that everything in the passage is historical and therefore has only a spiritual application to David in his dealings with Saul.  This completely overlooks the Scriptural fact that Saul is one of the greatest types of the Son of Perdition found anywhere in either Testament. (Others are Ahab, Goliath, Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, Sisera, Absalom, etc.) “Until these calamities be overpast” is to be compared with Luke 21:36 and Isaiah 26:20. We all recognize a normal prayer coming from a saint in any type of trouble. He asks for mercy because he trusts in God, and God’s “wings” are the wings of Matthew 23:37; Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11. The “calamities” might be anything from sickness and persecution to poverty and pain, but the context (“He shall send from heaven...Selah.” vs. 3) knocks all of the faculty and staff of Liberty University slap out of the saddle. Freerkson, Wemp, Kroll, and Wilmington couldn’t find the doctrinal references if their souls depended upon it, because the Scriptures were written primarily to teach doctrine (See 2 Tim. 3:16 in any translation), and they have no “scriptures.” Like the hypocrites at the World Congress of Fundamentalism (1990), they teach that any man who professes to have the Scriptures available today where he can read them, belongs to a “cult.” The price they pay for this arrogant stupidity is spiritual BLINDNESS. When it is said that God “performeth all things for me” it means that God will enable you to  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} :
\begin{compactenum}
    \item Understand His word.
    \item Pray and intercede.
    \item Walk, run, and breathe.
    \item Digest food.
    \item Read, write, teach, and preach.
    \item Make a living and feed the family.
    \item Forgive and minister to others.
    \item Avoid injury and death.
\end{compactenum}
Saul, who typifies Satan incarnate, kills people with his mouth and is likened to
“lions” (i.e., devils—in the plural, Mark 5:12 —- as part of the devil, as recorded in the infallible English, contrary to the opinions of 100 percent of the apostates). Satan is a lion (1 Pet. 5:8); his spiritual counterparts are therefore “lions” (vs. 4). }

The net is over the pit. It is a lion trap, and such traps were still used by natives in Africa as late as 1950. Drum beaters drive the lions into a jungle path where the concealed pit contains this net. When the body of the lion drops into the net, it triggers a release which causes the tree to snap upright. This tree is tied to a “leader” which closes the net and yanks the lion up in the air enmeshed in a thick rope “cage.” At the end of the Tribulation the UN troops, headed up by the Beast and the False Prophet, are slaughtered, and their leaders go into the Lake of Fire (Rev. 19:20). \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }

The heart needs to be “fixed” before the head is fixed. It is God who fixes the heart, when it becomes fixed ON HIM. The psalmist is determined to sing and give praise in any circumstances, exactly as Paul and Silas were determined to do “at midnight” (Acts 16:25). Four things have to “wake up” before God can be praised properly: \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} 
\begin{compactenum}
    \item “My glory” (vs. 8). Our “glory” is in the Lord Himself (see 1 Cor. 1:31). David is calling on his knowledge of God’s power and righteousness to furnish him with the right words.
    \item “Psaltery.” The small, stringed instrument (like a zither or a small lyre). It can be carried and played like a guitar or a mandolin.
    \item “Harp.” A larger stringed instrument standing upright, containing at least two full octaves. The psaltery was usually only a ten-stringed instrument—two notes over one octave.
    \item “I myself.” The player and the singer have to be “awakened.” Praise to God must be “in spirit and, in truth” (John 4:23), not some half-hearted, sleepy, dull presentation that has been memorized like a Paternoster, or an Ave Maria, or a Te Deum. David praises God with a “loud noise” (Ps. 98:4, 33:3).

How is it that David is unashamed to sing praises to God publicly before an entire nation? Why is God never praised by anyone on an international basis? Where are the songs of praise about Buddha and Mohammed? Lenin? The popes? If all religions are equal, why is it that only ONE has more than five hundred songs in a hymn book about its founder? What the world has needed since the days of Queen Victoria is a ruler who is not ashamed to brag about Jesus Christ publicly and praise God and His word on international television and radio networks. No such animal exists. The Pope praises Mary and mumbles a mass at times, but there has not been a king, pope, ambassador, dictator, emperor, or cardinal since 1900 that has stood up before the League of Nations or the United Nations and quoted Philippians 1:6--11 and Revelation 19:11-16. They all chicken out; not one real man in the lot. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }
