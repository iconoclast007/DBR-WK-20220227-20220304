%\textbf{Introduction:} There are ten references to ``just men'' in scripture. Proverb 9:9 tells us that a just man will listen to instruction and become wiser. Proverb 20:7 tells us that he will maintain integrity. Proverb 24:16 says that, when  he falls, he will get up and get back on the correct path.  Ecclesiastes 7:20 says that just men are difficult to find. Ecclesiastes 7:15 that a just man will go to his grace having nothing but integrity, while a wicked man prolongs his life.

[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.}\footnote{\textbf{Proverbs 15:28} - The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Through wisdom is an house \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{builded}; and by \fcolorbox{bone}{MYGOLD}{understanding} it is established:}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And by knowledge shall the chambers be \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{filled} with all \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{precious} and \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{pleasant} riches.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{A wise man \emph{is} strong; yea, a man of knowledge \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{increaseth} strength.}

[8] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.}\footnote{The connection of the word mischievous is clearly set in scripture in that it is used 5 times, in (1) Psalm 21:11, (2) Psalm 38:12, (3) Proverbs 24:8, (4) Ecclesiastes 10:13, and (5) Micah 7:3. Scripture sets the tone of mischievous as wicked and evil and not ``cute'' as used in the modern context. See, further, the use of the word ``mischief'' as above in verse 2. The word is perhaps best defined by its last use in Acts 13:10: And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?}
[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{The thought of foolishness \emph{is} sin: and the scorner \emph{is} an abomination to men.}

[10] I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. }\footnote{\textbf{Matthew 16:27} - For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.}\footnote{\textbf{1 Timothy 4:14} - Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:}\footnote{\textbf{Hebrews 4:12} - For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{My son, eat thou honey, because \emph{it} \emph{is} good; and the honeycomb, \emph{which} \emph{is} sweet to thy taste:}

[20] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For there shall be no reward to the evil \emph{man}; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.}\footnote{\textbf{Job 21:17} - How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.}

[23] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{These \emph{things} also \emph{belong} to the wise. \emph{It} \emph{is} not good to have respect of persons in judgment.}\footnote{\textbf{2 Chronicles 19:7} - Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.}\footnote{\textbf{Romans 2:11} - For there is no respect of persons with God.}\footnote{\textbf{Ephesians 6:9} - And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.}
[24] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{He that saith unto the wicked, Thou \emph{art} righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:}\footnote{\textbf{Romans 12:9} - Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.}
[25] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But to them that rebuke \emph{him} shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.}
